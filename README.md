# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection-using-ML
The "Online Payment Fraud Detection" project aims to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time. By leveraging machine learning models trained on historical transaction data, the system can distinguish between legitimate and suspicious activities.
Key Components of Online Payment Fraud Detection:
Data Collection:

Transaction details: amount, date, time, location, payment method.
User details: account information, browsing behavior, device information.
Historical data: past transactions, known fraud patterns.
Feature Engineering:

Creation of new features that help in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Examples include:
Transaction frequency
Average transaction amount
Geolocation consistency
Device fingerprinting
Machine Learning Models:

Supervised Learning: Models are trained on labeled datasets containing both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
Common algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, Neural Networks.
Unsupervised Learning: Models identify anomalies without labeled data.
Common algorithms: Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN), Autoencoders.
Real-time Processing:

Integration of models into the payment processing pipeline for real-time detection.
Use of streaming data platforms like Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, or AWS Kinesis.
Evaluation Metrics:

Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Balancing false positives and false negatives.
ROC-AUC: Evaluating the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Fraud Prevention Strategies:

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
Behavior Analytics
Velocity Checks (limits on transaction frequency)
Rule-based Filters

Tools and Technologies:
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
Real-time Processing: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, AWS Kinesis
Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions
